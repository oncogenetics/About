#### Abstract
**Summary:** In this article we present Locus Explorer, a data visualisation and exploration tool for genetic association data. Locus Explorer is written in R using the Shiny library, providing access to powerful R-based functions through a simple user interface. Locus Explorer allows users to simultaneously display genetic, statistical and biological data in a single image and allows dynamic zooming and customisation of the plot features. Publication quality plots may be downloaded in a variety of file formats.   
**Availability and implementation:** Locus Explorer is open source and runs through R and a web browser. It is available at https://github.com/oncogenetics/LocusExplorer, where user guides and example data are also provided.
