# Locus Explorer

We developed Locus Explorer a Shiny R Application – a web application framework for R – for locus plots used in XXX manuscript. Locus Explorer can be run locally using R studio with necessary packages installed, and it can also be run on our server at XXX.icr.ac.uk. The code will be available on GitHub. The application is interactive that includes selecting and zooming on the locus, annotation tracks, and downloading the resulting plots, and the data used for plotting. Data for plotting is stored in SQLite database which is accessed using R scripts. Plots are displayed mainly using RStudio, ggplot and ggbio. The application is on Beta stage, with most functionality in place and with performance issues. We are continuously working on additional minor features and for future versions the main focus will be speed of plotting process...
